From 2019 to 2021, I was a PhD student of Department of Indiana University, at Bloomington. Currently, I am an independent researcher. My research interests include optimization theory, statistical machine learning and their applications in bioinformatics. During the past two years, I have spent most of my leisure time on mathematics. I hope that I could find a person who loves math and works on research regarding applied/pure math as my PhD advisor.  In my perspective of view, working on a chanllenging math problem for about 5 years is worthwile, even if I may not solve it at the end. After I read [the fascinating story of Yitang Zhang](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/02/pursuit-beauty), I found that's exactly the way I want to live, even though I do not have the talent on math like Zhang. Everybody is supposed to persevere in what he/she truely loves.
