Currently, I am working on study preparation for a mathematics program. My research interests include everything about mathematics, such as algebra, analysis, and optimization theory. 

This year I partipated the preliminary round of 2024 Alibaba Global Mathematics Competition for the first time. Fortunately, I advanced to the finals. Each year tens of thousands of people take part in this competition and only contestants who rank  top 1% in the qualifying round will be on the list of the finalists.

My research experience has been really winding. In 2018, I went to the US for my PhD career. From 2019 to 2021, I was a PhD student of Indiana University, at Bloomington. At IU, it was my honor to follow [Roni Khardon](https://cgi.luddy.indiana.edu/~rkhardon/) for a short while and then [Yijie Wang](https://wyjhxq.github.io/) as my PhD advisor. Because of the trade war between the US and China, I had to go back to China and became an independent researcher.

During the past two years, I have spent most of my time on mathematics. Despite the unfortunate experience, I still have not given up my PhD dream. I will chase my dream and aspiration. I hope that I could find a person who loves math and works on research regarding applied/pure math as my PhD advisor. In my perspective of view, working on a chanllenging math problem for about 5 years or even longer is worthwile, even if I may not solve it at the end. After I read [the fascinating story of Yitang Zhang](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/02/pursuit-beauty) and watched [a documentary about Zhang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JklVkYq3NM), I found that's exactly the way I want to live, even though I do not have the talent on math like Zhang. Everybody is supposed to persevere in what she/he truely loves.

After I returned from the US to China, I became very thirsty for math. When I read mathematics or work on a math problem, I feel peaceful. I think it is thinking that makes a person peaceful. I like to walk and think. This is my way of doing research. Due to this, my life is kind of solitary.
