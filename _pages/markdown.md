## My solutions to some online self-assessment documents for M.Sc. Mathematics Program
### University of Potsdam's self-assessment document is available at [here](https://www.math.uni-potsdam.de/fileadmin/user_upload/images/Dateien/Self-assessment.pdf). My answers to those questions are available at [here](/files/self_assessment_on_math_knowledge1.pdf).


## Courses
I have taken/been taking some math courses via Coursera, edX, etc.
* [Optimization: principles and algorithms - Linear optimization](https://www.edx.org/learn/math/ecole-polytechnique-federale-de-lausanne-optimization-principles-and-algorithms-linear-optimization) ([Certificate](/files/EPFLx%20optimizationX-1%20Certificate%20_%20edX.pdf))
* [Differential Equations Part I Basic Theory](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ordinary-differential-equations) ([Certificate](https://coursera.org/share/b9d2bd6807a737b2c3889f13e1e4bb5d))
* [Introduction to Complex Analysis](https://www.coursera.org/learn/complex-analysis) ([Certificate](https://coursera.org/share/b9c8ec0aaa6532736c7b6ef5321a8d6c))
* [Differential Equations Part II Series Solutions](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-ordinary-differential-equations-part-2) ([Certificate](https://coursera.org/share/f29cc17973fe5edb5074e853cfa847cb))

## Books on optimization theory
I recommend the following books for people who want to learn optimization:
* Introduction to Nonlinear Optimization: Theory, Algorithms and Applications with MATLAB by Amir Beck
* First Order Methods in Optimization by Amir Beck
* Convex Optimization by Stephen Boyd & Lieven Vandenberghe

I also recommend Dr. Ryan Tibshirani's [Convex Optimization](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~ryantibs/convexopt/) course. You can find his lecture videos on YouTube and lecture notes on his website where you can also find the course assignments.

## Fourier series
This is [my notes on Fourier Series](/files/Notes_on_Fourier_Series.pdf) I made when I was self-studying Fourier Series. 
Fourier Series is a powerful tool for finding out the analytic expressions of infinite series. 
I keep updating my notes when I find something interesting or useful, in my view, about Fourier 
series. One of my final goals is to find out the closed form of [Apery's constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ap%C3%A9ry%27s_constant). 

## Real analysis
[Notes on real analysis](/files/real_analysis.pdf). The main references are Terence Tao's Analysis I and Analysis II, and Jixiu Chen, et al's Mathematical Analysis. 

## Complex analysis
[Notes on complex analysis](/files/complex_analysis.pdf).

## Exploration on Apery's constant
I am very interested in the research on Apery's constant. I did some research on this problem and my notes are available [here](/files/My_work_on_Apery_constant.pdf).

<!-- ## Locations of key files/directories

* Basic config options: _config.yml
* Top navigation bar config: _data/navigation.yml
* Single pages: _pages/
* Collections of pages are .md or .html files in:
  * _publications/
  * _portfolio/
  * _posts/
  * _teaching/
  * _talks/
* Footer: _includes/footer.html
* Static files (like PDFs): /files/
* Profile image (can set in _config.yml): images/profile.png

## Tips and hints

* Name a file ".md" to have it render in markdown, name it ".html" to render in HTML.
* Go to the [commit list](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/commits/master) (on your repo) to find the last version Github built with Jekyll. 
  * Green check: successful build
  * Orange circle: building
  * Red X: error
  * No icon: not built

## Buttons

Make any link standout more when applying the `.btn` class.

## Notices

**Watch out!** You can also add notices by appending `{: .notice}` to a paragraph.
{: .notice}

## HTML Tags

### Address Tag

<address>
  1 Infinite Loop<br /> Cupertino, CA 95014<br /> United States
</address>

### Anchor Tag (aka. Link)

This is an example of a [link](http://github.com "Github").

### Abbreviation Tag

The abbreviation CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets".

*[CSS]: Cascading Style Sheets

### Cite Tag

"Code is poetry." ---<cite>Automattic</cite>

### Code Tag

You will learn later on in these tests that `word-wrap: break-word;` will be your best friend.

### Strike Tag

This tag will let you <strike>strikeout text</strike>.

### Emphasize Tag

The emphasize tag should _italicize_ text.

### Insert Tag

This tag should denote <ins>inserted</ins> text.

### Keyboard Tag

This scarcely known tag emulates <kbd>keyboard text</kbd>, which is usually styled like the `<code>` tag.

### Preformatted Tag

This tag styles large blocks of code.

<pre>
.post-title {
  margin: 0 0 5px;
  font-weight: bold;
  font-size: 38px;
  line-height: 1.2;
  and here's a line of some really, really, really, really long text, just to see how the PRE tag handles it and to find out how it overflows;
}
</pre>

### Quote Tag

<q>Developers, developers, developers&#8230;</q> &#8211;Steve Ballmer

### Strong Tag

This tag shows **bold text**.

### Subscript Tag

Getting our science styling on with H<sub>2</sub>O, which should push the "2" down.

### Superscript Tag

Still sticking with science and Isaac Newton's E = MC<sup>2</sup>, which should lift the 2 up.

### Variable Tag

This allows you to denote <var>variables</var>. -->
