title: "Fourier Series"
excerpt: "This is my notes on Fourier Series I made when I was self-studying Fourier Series. 
Fourier Series is a powerful tool for finding out the analytic expressions of infinite series. 
I keep updating my notes when I find something interesting or useful, in my view, about Fourier 
series. One of my final goals is to find out the closed form of
