Challenges in advancing AI-based drug design to clinical trials often stem from incomplete datasets. Human experts can bring invaluable expertise and nuanced contextual understanding to the process of drug design. To harness the human intuition, we introduce a groundbreaking Human-In-the-Loop Drug Design (HIL-DD) framework. This system fosters a collaborative environment in which both AI and human experts co-design 3D molecular structures, anchored around a specific protein pocket.
