We present an ADMM algorithm to solve the generic $\ell_0$ sparse overlapping group lasso problem. Since the overlapping between groups are arbitrary, 
this problem is very hard. The theoretical analysis regarding the lower bounds and upper bounds of the optimal values of this problem is provided in this article.
